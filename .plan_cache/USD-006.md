# Plan: Human Dashboard

**Task ID:** USD-006
**Created:** 2026-02-07T11:31:00Z
**Project:** USDC Hackathon

## Objective

Build a dashboard for humans to view and manage their AAM (Agent Allowance Manager) hierarchy. This is the "manager" view showing pools, allowances, and agent spending.

## Context

- **AAM Contract:** 0x177d97C5D69D783DCa87D27E4344bb3b9a87D30d
- **Network:** Arc Testnet (Chain ID 5042002)
- **RPC:** https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
- **Existing script:** `scripts/hierarchy_status.sh` (CLI version)

## Requirements (to be refined)

1. **View hierarchy** — see all agents and their allowances
2. **View spending** — see what each agent has spent
3. **Manage allowances** — create, update, pause, revoke
4. **Deposit/withdraw** — manage pool balance
5. **Real-time updates** — see changes as they happen

## Tech Options

- **Web app:** Next.js + wagmi/viem + Tailwind
- **CLI enhanced:** Richer bash/python script
- **TUI:** Terminal UI with rich/textual (Python)

## Execution Steps

1. Clarify requirements with user
2. Choose tech stack
3. Build MVP
4. Test with deployed contract
5. Iterate

## Questions for User

- Web app or CLI/TUI?
- Read-only or full management (signing transactions)?
- Target users: just you, or public demo?
